# DOM
- Document element is a built-in object in java script that represents the whole page
- We can pick up certain elements of the document by the element's unique ID, CSS query selector, tag or class name
- .length gives us the count of the elements that are returned
- .textContent gives us the text inside the specified element

# Values & Datatypes
- Values in JS represent different types of data 
- two different datatypes in javascript are primitive types (e.g strings,boolean, undefined, null) and objects (e.g HTML Document)
- typeof "43 prints string but typeof 43 gives a number

# Operators
#### Examples on Operators
- typeof that is written before a value, gives the type of the value in a string quotes
- plus is an overloading operator that contatinates strings and adds numbers

# Variables
#### Using let
- let is a reserved JS keyword that declares a variable
- when I define a variable without giving it a value it will be undefined
#### Using const
- the value of the variable can't ever be changed
